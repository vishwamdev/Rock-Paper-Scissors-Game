# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This repository contains a simple console-based implementation of the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" (RPS) game, developed using Python. The player competes against the computer in multiple rounds of the game, with the computer randomly selecting its choice.

**Features:**
* User input validation to ensure a valid choice (rock, paper, or scissor).
* A randomized choice by the computer.
* Winning conditions based on the traditional rules:
  * Rock beats Scissor
  * Scissor beats Paper
  * Paper beats Rock
* The game can be played continuously, with an option to quit after each round.

**How to Play:**
1) Run the script.
2) Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissor).
3) The game will declare the result (win, lose, or tie).
4) Optionally, play another round or exit the game.

**Technologies Used:**
* Python
* Random module for computer's choice
* Loops and conditional statements for game logic
